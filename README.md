# ft_printf (125/100)

**ft_printf** is a project that requires us to implement our own version of the printf function from the C standard library. This project introduced us to variable arguments and output formatting in C.

## Features
- Custom implementation of the printf function.
- Support for various format specifiers, flags, and modifiers.
- Efficient and accurate output formatting.
- Integration with other projects within the 42 curriculum.

## Usage

This project is included in my Libft, please refer to my Libft page (https://github.com/Thawnder/Libft) for proper implementation in your code.

## Example
<pre>
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    return 0;
}
</pre>
